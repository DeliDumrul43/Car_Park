Car park automation
In my project, I used menu viem in the main menu so that I gained the function of returning all operations in a single form.
you can also install your own user database into the program

How did it happen on one page?
I transferred all the pages that I would use to a panel, extended the form and pulled it to places that the user could not see, 
then played with the positions of the panels and turned them into the places I wanted.
